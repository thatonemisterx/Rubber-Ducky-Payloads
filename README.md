# Rubber-Ducky-Payloads
This holds all of the payloads I coded for the USB Rubber Ducky. The "README" files for each of the injects are located in the ZIP files.
Each file will have in parentheses the operting system it will work on.
If there are issues with the injects, email me at the1misterxisalive@gmail.com
