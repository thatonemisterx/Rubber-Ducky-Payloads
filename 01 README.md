# Rubber-Ducky-Payloads
This holds all of the payloads I coded for the USB Rubber Ducky. The "README" files for each of the injects are located in the ZIP files.
Each file will have in parentheses the operting system it will work on.
If there are issues with the injects, email me at the1misterxisalive@gmail.com

## Rubber Ducky Payloads:

### WHAMegeddon
Maxes out the volume on the victim's computer before going to a link where "Last Christmas" by Wham! plays.

### Tab Attack!
Opens a new Google page before spamming the "Open New Tab" keybind. Very good for lagging computers/being a slight annoyance.

On Windows, it turns off the computer. For ChromeOS, it logs out the user.
